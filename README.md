# yourWebsite

Quick starting point to get your own website off the ground quickly

## Getting Started

To begin, create a fork of this repository

All of your work will be contained inside of template.html

## Making Changes

In this template, I have provided you with several easily configurable parameters. These include the header bar, the content box already placed on the page, and the colors.

The header bar can be configured by simply editing the text between `<h1>` and `</h1>`. The content box has its title text between `<h2>` and `</h2>`, with its content being contained inside of `<p>` and `</p>`. The colors are contained in hexidecimal string, and can be changed with a new one with use of a hexadecimal color selector like https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/.

## Adding New Content
I've included content boxes in the styling portion. You can add these as:
`<div class="content-box">
            <h2>Heading</h2>
            <p>Insert text here.</p>
        </div>
  `
Alternatively, you may want to add an image, you can start by uploading it to your repository. First, find the file for your desired image. Then, return to your repository, click add file, and upload files.

<img width="446" height="146" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00ce1173-8592-4b51-a1bf-84fe81d700bf" />

Drag your desired image in the dropdown, and click commit changes. Then, type your image's filename in the img src slot below, and fill out your desired details.

`        <div class="content-box">
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="image.filetype" alt="image alt text" class="responsive-image">
            </div>
            <p class="image-caption">caption</p>
        </div>` </br>
